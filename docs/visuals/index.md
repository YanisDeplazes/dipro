## Archival Photo Animation â€“ Visual Style Reference

Create subtle 3D motion from still archival images using parallax, light simulation, and particle effects to evoke a sense of presence and memory.

### Technical Notes

- Mask foreground, midground, and background layers in Photoshop.
- Animate parallax and depth using Premiere Pro or After Effects.
- Apply gentle camera motion (Z-axis push-in, slight pan).
- Add soft 8mm film overlays and borders for atmosphere.
- Maintain a muted, film-like color grade with minimal contrast changes.
